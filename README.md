# Angular Signature Field &mdash; Angular Demo

This is a demo showing the [angular-signature-field directive](https://github.com/jpkraemer/angularSignatureField) in action in a bare-bones angular app.
In our demo, the controller is implemented in `js/app.js`. It shows the image in a separate img tag when pressing Save, and clears the canvas when pressing Clear.

## Install

```
git clone https://github.com/jpkraemer/angularSignatureField-Angular-Example.git
cd angularSignatureField-Angular-Example
bower i
```

## Run

In the browser: `open index.html`
